## Ruby C-API

Ruby is extendable with C. And I wanted to know how. 

It covers defining classes, subclassing and calling a block. 

## Usage

Install required gems first

```
bundle install
```

Compile the extension:

```
rake compile[:ary]
```

Run the test suite

```
rake test
```

## What else?
